# 🧠 Project Document: **LocalGit**
*A Local-First Git-Like System for Safe and Flexible Development Workflows*

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

**LocalGit** is a **local-first version control system** inspired by GitHub/Git, but designed specifically for **isolated local experimentation**.

Instead of pushing experimental commits or creating cluttered branches on remote repositories, developers can use LocalGit to:
- Create multiple **local-only branches** (replicas) of a base branch.
- Experiment safely in **isolated environments**.
- Visualize diffs, merges, and commit trees — all **locally**.
- Sync only **clean, verified changes** to the actual remote Git repo when ready.

Think of it as a **sandboxed version control manager**, letting developers freely experiment without touching the real Git history until they’re confident.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern Git workflows are powerful but rigid when it comes to **safe experimentation**. Developers often hesitate to commit incomplete work to remote repositories because:
- Commits clutter the remote history.
- Rewriting commit history can be risky.
- Creating local clones of a repo is space-inefficient.

Current tools (Git, GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, etc.) do not provide a **sandbox environment** for branching, committing, and diffing that is **completely local** and **disconnected from Git’s remote lifecycle**.

---

## 💡 Core Idea

LocalGit introduces the concept of **Local Branch Zones (LBZs)**:
- Each LBZ is a **lightweight copy** of a base branch (e.g., `feature/auth`).
- Within each LBZ, developers can:
  - Create commits
  - Generate diffs
  - View commit graphs
  - Revert or stash changes  
  — all without touching the main `.git` folder or the remote repo.

Once the developer is satisfied, LocalGit can:
- Export a patch or a single squashed commit.
- Sync cleanly with Git.
- Optionally auto-create a Git branch.

## 🧩 Key Features

| Category | Feature | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 🗂️ Local Branching | Create Local Branch Zones (LBZ) | Lightweight isolated branches derived from an existing branch |
| 🧱 Diff Engine | Local Diffing Algorithm | Built-in diff/merge logic independent of Git’s diff tool |
| 🕹️ Commit Visualization | Graph View | Interactive visual of local commits and their relationships |
| 🧪 Experiment Mode | Sandbox Workflows | Work in branches without polluting the main repo |
| 🔄 Sync & Patch | Clean Export | Export a patch or squashed commit to sync with Git |
| 🧰 Local Storage | Efficient Copy Management | Store file diffs instead of full file copies to save space |
| 🧭 Version Browser | Timeline Explorer | Navigate through local changes using a version timeline |
| 🧼 Cleanup Tools | Prune Experiments | Safely delete or archive local branches |
| 🔒 Offline Mode | Fully Local | Works without internet or GitHub integration |

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

**Frontend (UI):**
- 🦀 **Tauri** — lightweight desktop shell (faster than Electron)
- ⚛️ **React + TypeScript** — component-based UI
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** — modern styling system
- 📊 **D3.js** — for rendering commit graphs and diffs

**Backend (Core Engine):**
- 🦀 **Rust** — for performance-critical operations (diffing, file IO)
- 🧠 Custom Diffing Engine — text & binary diff logic, merge conflict detection
- 🧩 **SQLite** or **Sled (Rust embedded DB)** — to store metadata about branches and commits

**Filesystem Structure:**
/project-root
├── .localgit/
│ ├── zones/
│ │ ├── lbz-1/
│ │ └── lbz-2/
│ ├── diffs/
│ ├── metadata.db
└── ...

## 🧠 How It Works (Conceptually)

1. **Initialization:**  
   LocalGit scans the repo and creates a `.localgit` directory to track local zones and diffs.

2. **Creating an LBZ:**  
   - User creates a new local zone (`lbz-new-feature`) from `feature/auth`.
   - LocalGit clones only metadata (file hashes, not contents).

3. **Making Changes:**  
   - Edits are tracked locally via diff snapshots.
   - A Rust-based diff engine computes deltas efficiently.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - The UI displays the commit tree of local branches with merge and diff overlays.

5. **Sync/Export:**  
   - User exports a patch (as `.patch` or `.diff`) or squashes commits into a clean Git branch.

---

## 🚀 Advanced Feature Ideas

- **AI Diff Summarizer:** Generate natural language summaries of diffs (using local LLMs or WASM models).
- **Visual Merge Conflicts:** Side-by-side UI for resolving local conflicts visually.
- **Branch Replay Engine:** Replay or rebase LBZs onto updated base branches.
- **Autosave History:** Automatic checkpointing of uncommitted changes.
- **Git Integration Layer:** Optional plugin to push selected commits to Git.

## 🧩 Differentiators

| Existing Tool | Limitation | LocalGit Advantage |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Git | Remote-focused, commits are permanent | Fully local, reversible experiments |
| GitHub Desktop | No local-only branching | Sandbox branches isolated from remote |
| GitLens | Visualization only | Full local branch simulation |
| Fork | UI heavy, tied to Git operations | Lightweight, independent local logic |

---

## 🎨 Example User Flow

1. Clone or open an existing Git repo in LocalGit.
2. Create a **Local Branch Zone (LBZ)** from a branch (`feature/api`).
3. Modify files freely — LocalGit auto-tracks changes.
4. View diffs or revert specific files/commits.
5. Merge or compare local branches.
6. Export final clean commit → apply to Git repo.

---

## 🧱 Possible Challenges

- Efficiently handling large binary files.
- Keeping diff computation fast for large codebases.
- Designing a visual merge system that’s intuitive.
- File locking and concurrency management.
- Cross-platform filesystem support (Windows/Linux/macOS).

## 🧭 Roadmap (High-Level)

| Phase | Goal | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Core Engine | Implement local diff engine, file tracking, and LBZ logic in Rust |
| **Phase 2** | Tauri Frontend | Basic UI for creating branches, viewing diffs, and commit history |
| **Phase 3** | Visualization Layer | Add D3-powered graph view and visual merge editor |
| **Phase 4** | Git Sync | Enable export to Git as patches or squashed commits |
| **Phase 5** | AI Enhancements | Integrate local summarization and diff insights |

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

- Local plugin system (custom diff handlers, formatters)
- Integration with editors (VS Code plugin)
- Cloud backup for `.localgit` metadata
- Collaborative local sessions via LAN

---

## 📜 Summary

**LocalGit** is designed for developers who want **creative freedom, experimentation, and safety** — all without the overhead or risks of remote Git operations.  

It’s **Git without the fear**, combining the flexibility of a sandbox with the rigor of version control.  

> “Experiment locally. Commit confidently.”
